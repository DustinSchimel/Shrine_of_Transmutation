# Shrine of Transmutation
Adds the Shrine of Transmutation, which when offered a white, green, or red item will have a chance to reroll that item to another of the same rarity, upgrade it, downgrade it, or even remove it. One item is chosen at random from the player's inventory and scrap always takes priority.
